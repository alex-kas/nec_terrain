*You can read [here](exploit-th.md) a theoretical explanation on how this phone is exploited and used terms.*

---

### Exploit **mandatory** pre-requisits

#### Phone

You need a NEC Terrain phone.

#### USB Debugging

The option `USB Debugging` found in *Settings->Developer options* must be enabled.

#### Linux desktop/laptop with `adb` and a USB cable

*All scripts here are developed with linux in mind. They are portable easily to windows but this is not expected to be
done here.*

You must have `adb` installed on your pc and have a USB cable to connect your phone with your pc.

#### Stock GPT. *THE MOST CRUCIAL PART*

It is extremely crucial for the scripts to work as expected that your stock GPT table is **EXACTLY** like that

```
The point of **MAIN CONCERN** is the gap between partitions 3 and 4. It must be there and the end of partition 3 and the beginning
of partition 4 must be **EXACTLY** as above.

"Stock" means the configuration before any possible use of the scripts from here or
before using the **terroot** program or before any other means of altering.

The script in `recovery/` directory here named [adbtestgpt.sh]() gets the GPT table from the phone and shows it
for you. The script does not take decisions. It is you, who compares and decides what to do!

#### micro-SD card

For the task of flashing new boot image and for the backup during the repartitioning you need a micro-SD card. It should 
have 12MiB free for the boot image, up to 5.2GiB free for the data backup (this is the maximum of partitions
userdata (number 13) and GROW (number 14) together)
and 500MiB free for a possible system
backup.

The card should be partitioned as MBR with a partition. In other words, it should be seen in linux as
```
/dev/mmcblk0
```
and its partition as
```
/dev/mmcblk0p1
```
The `/dev/mmcblk0p1` partition must be formatted as `vfat`.

In even simple words, if you examine your SD card in `disks` utility on your pc you should see:
```
Partitioning: Master Boot Record
Device: /dev/mmcblk0p1
Contents: vfat
```

#### Set? Ready? GO!
